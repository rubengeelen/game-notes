        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Here you can find answers to questions I would assume people might have when reading this blog.</p>

        <p>Why am I writing this? There are various reasons:
          <ul>
              <li>I have never considered myself as a creative person. To me, writing out these small bits of texts, are a way to try to express myself in a creative way.</li>
              <li>I am someone who thinks a lot about things. Writing out my thoughts is a way to get things out of my mind, without foregoing them.</li>
              <li>There is value in my thoughts. By saving these thoughts in a place that I can easily revisit, I am able to see patterns in my thinking and distill subconscious ways of thinking.</li>
              <li>Having this place on the internet feels like home to me. I appreciate the style, the idea of having my thoughts collected somewhere.</li>
              <li>It is likely I will never have children because I do not believe that I can be both a good and a happy parent. Instead of sharing wisdom and experience with my children, I will share them with whoever reads this.</li>
          </ul>

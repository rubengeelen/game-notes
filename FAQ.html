        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Here you can find answers to questions I would assume people might have when reading this blog.
          
          Should I push this through ChatGPT and let it optimize my text?
          - The main purpose of this blog is to express myself and let thoughts run freely. It is not about writing stories.
          - There is definitely value in ChatGPT but it does not have a place here (aside from helping me set up the infrastructure of the blog / website).

          Why am I writing this? There are various reasons:
          - I have never considered myself as a creative person. To me, writing out these small bits of texts, are a way to try to express myself in a creative way.
          - I am someone who thinks a lot about things. Writing out my thoughts is a way to get things out of my mind, without foregoing them.
          - There is value in my thoughts. By saving these thoughts in a place that I can easily revisit, I am able to see patterns in my thinking and distill subconscious ways of thinking.
          - Having this place on the internet feels like home to me. I appreciate the style, the idea of having my thoughts collected somewhere.
          - It is likely I will never have children because I do not believe that I can be both a good and a happy parent. Instead of sharing wisdom and experience with my children, I will share them with whoever reads this.

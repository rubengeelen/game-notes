  <h1>Alter Egos</h1>

  If there is a key thing that I would describe myself, it is obsession. Whenever I do something, I go all-in. Be it delivering a project, upgrading my wardrobe, getting into a certain sport. 
  I always deemed this to be quality in life. Athletes for example become great by being obessive about their sports. They are consistent, determined, focussed. 
  The idea of getting into the zone, of embracing this different human being, e.g., Black Mamba Kobe Bryant, speaks to me.
  One is perfectely able to define this alter ego based on the results one wants to achieve, and live it. It is like a switch. 
  You define the alter ego, prepare a routine to get into it, and practice staying into it. The gym is a perfet example of this: you take your preworkout, listen to motivational music, and just start pushing.
  
  Similar in a professional setting one is able to define a certain alter ego to embrace: the way you dress yourself, the way you speak, the way you approach certain tasks, etc.
  It makes you think of the rules of the game, strategize your approach, execute, and reflect to optimize.
  The value in the idea of those alter egos is phenomenal to me. By setting goals and reducing it to the kind of person that will achieve these goals.
  
  However, both of the above examples are effective only to a certain extent. Although this approach might be effective to reach certain physical or professional goals, it leads to friction when wanting to connect with others.
  While being in the zone, one is not a pleasant person to be around with. Being in the zone is about focus, removing distractions, limiting social interactions and fighting your way through challenges.
  It begs the question, how could one still leverage the value these alter egos uphold while not foregoing / disabling oneself from a social point of view?

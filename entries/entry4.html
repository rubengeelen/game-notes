  There are so many things I would like to writing about.

  The similarity between sports and business. What makes athletes succeed and how to carry over to your work.
  - Train at a level that is more challenging than the one you would need to perform. You wont suddenly tap into your best self when it is game day. You should prepare at 150% to perform at 100%.
  - Running at 15km/hr pushed you to run with better form, more focus, higher intensity. This you can then apply when running at an easier pace. There is value in pushing limits.
  - The importance of warm up. Often times one does not feel like doing sports. By taking small, seemingly irrelevant steps, one can get himself in a state of ready for work.
  - Consistency is where the real challenge sits. No one has issues with going for a run until they puke. But the percentage of people that is able to consistently go for a run every single day...
  - Things in life are not difficult to execute. Where it become difficult is when they have to be done consistently.
  - Environment is everything. One should put himself in an environment that fuels himself. Live somewhere where you have easy access to sports, nature, motivated people, smart people, ambitious people.
  - Getting into a state of focus.
  - Importance of trust.

  What personally drives me and how to artificially get into the zone by setting myself up for it.
  - The feeling of achieving success and accomplishment.
  -- Receiving positive reviews after a few months of consistent hard work.
  -- Looking lean and strong. The result of months of eating healthily and consistent exercise.

  The value of consistently improving oneself by systematically focussing on those things that have the highest marginal benefit to you.
  - At this moment, the one thing that I could do to significantly improve my life is to meditate on a consistent basis.

  Professional goals
  - Revisit project Wrap, establish learnings, summarize a case.
  - Making senior associate in 2025.
  - Leading the Belgium office of Alvarez and Marsal.
  
  Personal goals
  - Get lean and have a visible six pack. Weight should be c. 87kg.
  - Maintain this fitness and gradually build muscle.
  - Upgrade the wardrobe entirely (clean up everything from the basics and invest in two styles: personal and professional outfits).
  - Meditation, yoga, and relaxation (watching movies, writing blog, getting massages).
  - Keep renting this place.
  
  Social goals
  - Developing the social alter ego of myself and put it out there.
  - Reading the book "Captivate"
  - Invite people over to your place
  - Be selective with whom you spend your time:
  -- Thibault Cloet: MTB, adventure, travel
  -- Thibault Vandenhove, Viktor, Jan: fine wining and dining, travel
  -- Roberto, Emmanuel: locals in Antwerp, having drinks
  -- The Brick: TBD - would like to develop a social circle at the gym
  -- Sus, Arne: career-like minded people, travel
  -- High school friends: just stay in touch

  What would be the traits of this social alter ego?
  - Approachable
  - Attentive
  - Exiting
  - Aware

  How would you describe your professional alter ego?
  - Knowledgeable
  - Effective
  - Determined
  - Pet peeves: uncommitted, unrespectfull, lack of knowledge, weakness.

  Where did I drop the ball on project Wrap?
  - I should never have allowed others to make changes in the model. It led to a lot of frustration and me just not taking ownership of the model anymore.
  - I should have pushed back on workload and should have communicated my workload better to prevent having to work too many hours.
  - Big picture thinking, spending time going through the outcome of analyses.
  
  Points of improvement
  - Model
  -- Modelling the debt and lease liabilities better: base structure should be different, i.e., vertically, split between cash/non-cash, allowing for scenarios, etc.
  -- Output 
  
  Things that I did well
  - The model structure was solid for having built a 3st for the first time. I have a lot more comfort going forward with this.
  - Stakeholder management, i.e., developing relationships with stakeholders.
  - Coaching of Nadine.
  - Feedback to Troy.
  
  Your personal alter ego?
  - Reflective
  - Mindful
  - Kind
  
  What could be your killer routine?
  - Start your day the day before by planning your deep workinging hours the day after.
  - Start early such that you have sufficient time to get quality work done.

  There are certain activities that unlock the mind. Going for a walk, taking a shower, watching a movie, going for a run. Just tap into these activities and log whatever pops up in your mind.

  I get so fucking annoyed with certain people their behaviour.
  - The fat foreigner in the sauna caughing up the entire place.
  - That one colleague knowing jack shit about modelling, giving stupid tasks, and not being able to answer any fucking question.
  - The stupid girlfriend being unable to properly communicate with me.

  Being alone feels lonely only at certain times:
  - Sunday evenings with the workweek ahead.

  What makes me feel alive?
  - Have people come over and listen to them, share your money with them, give them a good time.
  - Riding a spinning bike with hardstyle music on.
  - Having a glass of alcohol, watching a good movie, while eating a kapsalon, spaghetti, french fries.
  - Receiving very good feedback from the team.

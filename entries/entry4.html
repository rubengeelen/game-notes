  There are so many things I would like to writing about.

  The similarity between sports and business. What makes athletes succeed and how to carry over to your work.
  - Train at a level that is more challenging than the one you would need to perform. You wont suddenly tap into your best self when it is game day. You should prepare at 150% to perform at 100%.
  - Running at 15km/hr pushed you to run with better form, more focus, higher intensity. This you can then apply when running at an easier pace. There is value in pushing limits.
  - The importance of warm up. Often times one does not feel like doing sports. By taking small, seemingly irrelevant steps, one can get himself in a state of ready for work.
  - Consistency is where the real challenge sits. No one has issues with going for a run until they puke. But the percentage of people that is able to consistently go for a run every single day...
  - Things in life are not difficult to execute. Where it become difficult is when they have to be done consistently.
  - Environment is everything. One should put himself in an environment that fuels himself. Live somewhere where you have easy access to sports, nature, motivated people, smart people, ambitious people.
  - Getting into a state of focus.
  - Importance of trust.

  What personally drives me and how to artificially get into the zone by setting myself up for it.
  - The feeling of achieving success and accomplishment.
  -- Receiving positive reviews after a few months of consistent hard work.
  -- Looking lean and strong. The result of months of eating healthily and consistent exercise.

  The value of consistently improveing oneself by systematically focussing on those things that have the highest marginal benefit to you.
  - At this moment, the one thing that I could do to significantly improve my life is to meditate on a consistent basis.

  Professional goals
  - Revisit project Wrap, establish learnings, summarize a case.
  - Making senior associate in 2025.

  Personal goals

  - Upgrade the wardrobe entirely (clean up everything from the basics and invest in two styles: personal and professional outfits).
  - Meditation, yoga, and relaxation (watching movies, writing blog, getting massages).
  - Keep renting this place 
  
  Social goals
  - Developing the social alter ego of myself and put it out there.
  - Reading the book "Captivate"
  - Invite people over to your place
  - Be selective with whom you spend your time:
  -- Thibault Cloet: MTB, adventure, travel
  -- Thibault Vandenhove, Viktor, Jan: fine wining and dining, travel
  -- Roberto, Emmanuel: locals in Antwerp, having drinks
  -- The Brick: TBD - would like to develop a social circle at the gym
  -- Sus, Arne: career-like minded people, travel
  -- High school friends: just stay in touch
  
  There are certain activities that unlock the mind. Going for a walk, taking a shower, watching a movie, going for a run. Just tap into these activities and log whatever pops up in your mind.

  There are so many things I would like to writing about.

  Your five years with Mathilde were meaningful and there is no harm in moving on. 
  - Connecting with yourself, others, and the world.
  - Mindfully engaging with your friends; having them come over, do things together.
  - No need to find a girlfriend now - you are not yet at your best meaning the partner you would attract is not the best one - yet.
  - Getting the sixpack is now the main goal for the next 4 weeks: OMAD, focus on recovery / meditation / stretching. Routine: Mon-Fri -> morning workouts + evening cardio sessions. Sat-Sun -> cycling, long walks, massages, recovery.
  - You are starting to get sharp, more mindful, more connected to yourself and others.
  
  The similarity between sports and business. What makes athletes succeed and how to carry over to your work.
  - Train at a level that is more challenging than the one you would need to perform. You wont suddenly tap into your best self when it is game day. You should prepare at 150% to perform at 100%.
  - Running at 15km/hr pushed you to run with better form, more focus, higher intensity. This you can then apply when running at an easier pace. There is value in pushing limits.
  - The importance of warm up. Often times one does not feel like doing sports. By taking small, seemingly irrelevant steps, one can get himself in a state of ready for work.
  - Consistency is where the real challenge sits. No one has issues with going for a run until they puke. But the percentage of people that is able to consistently go for a run every single day...
  - Things in life are not difficult to execute. Where it become difficult is when they have to be done consistently.
  - Environment is everything. One should put himself in an environment that fuels himself. Live somewhere where you have easy access to sports, nature, motivated people, smart people, ambitious people.
  - Getting into a state of focus.
  - Importance of trust.

  What personally drives me and how to artificially get into the zone by setting myself up for it.
  - The feeling of achieving success and accomplishment.
  -- Receiving positive reviews after a few months of consistent hard work.
  -- Looking lean and strong. The result of months of eating healthily and consistent exercise.

  The value of consistently improving oneself by systematically focussing on those things that have the highest marginal benefit to you.
  - At this moment, the one thing that I could do to significantly improve my life is to meditate on a consistent basis.

  Professional goals
  - Revisit project Wrap, establish learnings, summarize a case.
  - Making senior associate in 2025.
  - Leading the Belgium office of Alvarez and Marsal.
  
  Personal goals
  - Currently living in Antwerp - I would deem this a temporary place that will enable me to get fit, establish friendships, build career momentum, and live closer to myself.
  - Keep renting this place.
  - Get lean and have a visible six pack. Weight should be c. 87kg.
  - Maintain this fitness and gradually build muscle.
  - Upgrade the wardrobe entirely (clean up everything from the basics and invest in two styles: personal and professional outfits).
  - Meditation, yoga, and relaxation (watching movies, writing blog, getting massages).
  - Get a car. Aside from the monetary aspect, having a car opens up so many things you could do: just ride, travel to campings, MTB areas, the coast, friends and family.
    
  Social goals
  - What has been working
  -- Having people come over
  -- Be more approachable
  -- Post things on Instagram ~ city vibes, events, your appartment
  -- Lose weight
  -- Meditate
  -- Dress better
  -- Tinder
  -- Transfer to Crossfit over summer - when lean and comfortable training w/ naked upper body (Crossfit is fun / effective and people are more open than in the gym)
    - Developing the social alter ego of myself and put it out there.
  - Reading the book "Captivate"
  - Invite people over to your place
  -- A summer party at your terrasse
  -- A birthday party at Fiera
  -- Wine tasting
  - Dare to go out there as well - when people invite you
  - Be selective with whom you spend your time:
  -- Thibault Cloet: MTB, adventure, travel
  -- Thibault Vandenhove, Viktor, Jan, Matthijs, Dries: fine wining and dining, travel
  -- Roberto, Emmanuel: locals in Antwerp, having drinks
  -- The Brick: TBD - would like to develop a social circle at the gym
  -- Sus, Arne: career-like minded people, travel
  -- High school friends: just stay in touch
  
  What would be the traits of this social alter ego?
  - Inner thoughts shut off
  - Approachable
  - Attentive, actively listening
  - Exiting
  - Talking about things that excite you as well, asking their advice, showing pictures

  How would you describe your professional alter ego?
  - Knowledgeable
  - Effective
  - Determined
  - Pet peeves: uncommitted, unrespectfull, lack of knowledge, weakness.

  Where did I drop the ball on project Wrap?
  - I should never have allowed others to make changes in the model. It led to a lot of frustration and me just not taking ownership of the model anymore.
  - I should have pushed back on workload and should have communicated my workload better to prevent having to work too many hours.
  - Big picture thinking, spending time going through the outcome of analyses.
  
  Points of improvement
  - Model
  -- Modelling the debt and lease liabilities better: base structure should be different, i.e., vertically, split between cash/non-cash, allowing for scenarios, etc.
  -- Output 
  
  Things that I did well
  - The model structure was solid for having built a 3st for the first time. I have a lot more comfort going forward with this.
  - Stakeholder management, i.e., developing relationships with stakeholders.
  - Coaching of Nadine.
  - Feedback to Troy.
  
  Your personal alter ego?
  - Reflective
  - Mindful
  - Kind
  
  I get so fucking annoyed with certain people their behaviour.
  - The fat foreigner in the sauna caughing up the entire place.
  - That one colleague knowing jack shit about modelling, giving stupid tasks, and not being able to answer any fucking question.
  - The stupid girlfriend being unable to properly communicate with me.
  Could these behaviours be less impactful for a different persona? I guess a compassionate one could certainly help.
  
  Being alone feels lonely only at certain times:
  - Sunday evenings with the workweek ahead.
  - During birthday parties, holidays, or weekends - times which you could normally spend with a significant other.
  - They will feel even lonier when seeing Mathilde spend time with a new boyfriend, with the cats, at the house in Laarne.

  Sometimes, I just want to drink and not think about work. Work requires me to problem solve and it's part of my brain that I just do not feel like tapping into - because it takes quite some effort.

  What is the point of all of this? Looking back over the last 4 months: these were great months. Why do I still feel so empty - if that is the right word?
  - The last months were about generating results, accomplishments. Although those led to feel-good moments, they were only short-lived.
  - The feeling you have right now is the need for connection with the world, with people, with a partner.
  - I overcome loneliness by intentionally creating connection — with friends who get me, strangers who see me, and eventually, a partner who meets me. 
  - But I also practice being with myself — without needing to escape that solitude. I do so through journalling, meditation, exercise - generally just taking care of myself.
  
  What could I do differently in the next four months to avoid this feeling?
  - Open yourself up to connecting with yourself and with others. Dare to reach out, consistently invest in others, be approachable wherever you go.
  - Do more of the things that allow you to build a connection, both with yourself, with others, and with the world.
  - Zoom inwards through meditation and journalling / writing blog posts. It will make everything else more effective.

  ===
  What makes me feel connected with myself?
  - Blogging
  - Taking a shower
  - Watching a movie
  - Sports (cardio, once warmed up and in a certain zone)
  - Having a glass of alcohol, watching a good movie, while eating a kapsalon, spaghetti, french fries.
  - Receiving very good feedback from the team.
  - Performing an intense workout session; no aches, comfortable clothing, good music, good amount of preworkout, well rested. Yes, would die for these kind of workouts.

  How does it feel when engaging in these activities?
  - It feels as if they unlock a new dimension in my mind.
  - I am free of worries and anxiety. 
  - I feel absorbed by the activity.

  ===
  What makes me feel connected with others?
  - Just have simple interactions with people.
  - Have people come over and listen to them, share your money with them, give them a good time.
  - Making friendly eye contact with someone else.
  - Having a chat in the sauna with someone else.
  - Asking someone for advice.

  How do I feel when engaging in these activities?
  - During, I feel somehow connected to the others.
  - After, I feel energized and grateful for having these people around me.

  Relationship thoughts
  - Perhaps my perspective on love changes after reading this one book arriving tomorrow? Love for myself and love for others.
  - I keep falling into certain traps that prevent me from truly being happy. Trap of falling into this alter ego of professional elitist - thinking this could replace connection with world.
  - I long for connection more than anything else - I have been living the perfect life over the last months but still feel completely empty. Connection with myself, others, the world.
  - I did not understand this while living together with Mathilde and was seeking for fulfillment in work, fitness, material elements. Rather than focus on feeling.
  - The reason why I am beginning to understand this only now is because I have achieved all of those things and learned none of these give the fulfillment I am looking for.
  - I must seek them outside of work. This is not something that comes natural to me
  - Always need to think of that thing I mentioned to therapist: Mathilde prevents me from being me true self, that one that goes all in. But it is not that black and white.
    This Ruben is only part of it. There is also a Ruben that wants to go to flower markets,  to have ice cream, to go to wineyards, picnic in the park, eat spaghetti.
    The challenges lays in finding a way to make all of them happy.
  - Just a thought scenario but could Ruben also be happy if he did not pursue this kind of career or level of fitness? Could he be happy by embracing a completely different set of values?
  - Why has Mathilde been in so many ways but could I not understand this when being with her? Simple things like, going to the Brick, going to techno festivals, the value of crying. 
  - I cant put my finger on what the cause is yet but I am starting to understand things. 
  - In what ways have I changed over the last months?
    - Have been pushing my social relationships myself, not falling back on others.
    - I have been crying a lot over the last months.
    - I am beginning to understand I have been out of touch with the world, disconnected and how it affects me.
    - This disconnection might be a cause for the relationship problems we have had.
    - Solely focussing on the alter ego of going all in, completely disregarding others does not provide fulfillment.
    - I can understand the value of the relationship given the gap that I currently experience.
  - Is there any value in revisiting experiencing and reflecting on these?
    - Therapy -> so completely misaligned and she not 'seeing' certain things
    - London -> too much noise for me
    - Arguments -> not giving enough space
  - Note: It is not my intention to get back together with Mathilde. However, it is my duty to learn something from the relationship else I will keep falling in the same trap.

  Professional tips
  - When doing an analysis and you dont seem to understand it, just gather more information. At some point you will just understand the problem.
  - Underpromise, overdeliver. Manage expectations, keep things up your sleeve --> makes work more exciting and more comfortable. If you dont, it will drain you because others do not care about your wellbeing / time.
  - Networking works best when it is happens naturally and authentically. And let this be your main focus point at this moment, i.e., being present and connecting with yourself, other, the world.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  Some thoughts
  - You should get a girlfriend from Antwerp. You love the city, you see yourself living there, now it is time to find someone that lives there as well - someone from Antwerp.
  - Mathilde was likely not the right person for you. It is true that you should have spent more effort into listening to her, communicating, etc.
    However, the base effort to love one another was just too much. It sucked so much energy out of you such that there was none left to enjoy being together.
  - Perhaps having a baby is not such a bad idea after all - seeing how beautiful it us with Sus.
  - Perhaps you should start telling more of your stories as well, just share things about yourself such that you give people the chance to connect with you.
    - Personal interests: MTB, blogging, sauna and relaxation
    - Work: strategic decisions, money, prestige
    - Social: travel, girlfriends, etc.
  - Perhaps you could take the next month leaning down a bit more but you may already be happy where you have gotten. No stress.

  <h1>Header</h1>

  - Build social capital
  - Be friendly 
  - I just joined - I am a tool to be used. I must be serviceable and provide value.
  - No task is too small, no discussion or person is beneath me.
  - Everything should be tackled head-on with clear communication and reporting.
  
  The full year should focus on work. This is one of the key parameters that I can let lose.
  It will take less effort the longer I am working at A&M.
  
  First half year will also be about achieving target weight of 87kg and maintaining so.
  Once achieved, I will be able to invest in a wardrobe and improve my styling.
  Idea is that better fitness = better looks = more confidence. I would like to get this sorted for once and for all.
  
  On a continuous basis, I should look to have people come over - which I have been doing well throughout Q1.
  I should be open to say yes to invites and disregard the cost to travel.
  
  Once the home in Laarne is dealt with, I can focus on sorting out a car that will enable me to travel a lot more.
  I am very keen to travel across Europe by car to do sports (MTB).
  
  Throughout the entire period it is my goal to develop mental strength through meditation, relaxation, and blogging.
  This will allow me to have a higher awareness of myself and will aid in developing the social skills for Antwerp.
  
  ===
  
  Ask Mathilde for help with 
  - cleaning up the apartment to support social invites: table at terrasse, clean windows, other stuff to buy to make it pleasant, etc.
  - how to connect with locals, e.g., what if people do not ask me back, how to leverage events, what about gym, etc.
  - thinking about events I could do, e.g., summer party, birthday party, etc.
  
  ===
  
  Just do one crossfit and pilates class every week. This has the highest marginal benefit at this moment.

  ===

  Get motorcycle license; travel by bike,

  Might this be my all-time low?
  - Received feedback that I should be mindful about how I log my hours. Consistently 10hrs seems strange to the client.
  - Public holiday in Belgium but have to work.
  - Have been making a mistake in the model which now popped up.
  - Public holiday in Belgium and very nice weather, meaning many people socialize and go out to do things.
  - Thus, me sitting at home, working in the heat, resolving errors, without at this moment many friends (nor a partner) to spend time with.
  - Looking at social media would this only make much worse.
  - Those hours that I am doing, is this all worth it?
  
  Approach?
  - Center yourself by focussing on the breath. It does not change things such as not having a partner but it takes away the impact it has on your wellbeing.
  - Romans 8:18: "I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us."
  - We could add some rationale to the above:
    - Feedback is valid but only applies to last week. I should have spread those hours. All other days I have been working a lot more than 10hr so dont care.
    - Public holidays: could have asked for day off in the Netherlands. Wont be an issue anymore because in future I will have a Belgian contract.
    - Mistake in the model was apparent already in the past but never flagged. Should have taken that bullet earlier.
    - The fact that I would like to take advantage of this, indicates there is a social component within me. That is what this whole phase is about, exploring yourself.
    - You have been making friends, just not close enough to spend 100% of the moments like these together. You are definitely being invited to close parties.
      Additionally, perhaps this is the balance that you are looking for. Having friends to spend time with but not that close that you dont have time for yourself anymore.
      Without a partner indeed because you took it on yourself to break up with Mathilde because the relationship was not doing you any good. 
        This year is a transition period where one of the aims is to get to live closer to yourself. You will find a suitable partner at last.
    - Life goes with ups and downs (same as work). There is value in noting moments like this because at certain times you can aggregate those and look back on them.
      This is about just noticing without evaluating.

  What is interesting?
  - Emmanuel sending me videos about a techno party he went to - it should happen sometime that we do this together! Joint activities = key to make friends.
  - Me feeling a lot better and posting a video on IG - casually about fact that everyone is having holidays and I have to work. Mathilde, Maxime, Anton reacting to it!

  Leaving A&M
  - Looking back at the last two years, am I generally happy with how everything has been going?
  - I guess I was, aside from a few moments where it really really sucked.
  - Question is, should  I still pursue this career given.

  Project learnings
  - The setup of the business plan model was definitely good for a first time doing so
  - Some modelling aspects kept bugging us: properly modelling debt and leasing schedules, checks, actuals versus budget, aggregating cash-ins and cash-outs in a net position
  - What worked well: thinking through certain modelling aspects, building an entity before scaling, gradually layering in certain aspects
  - One should work as little as possible during the weekens. I did way to many hours in the weekends. I could also ask for time off during the workweek.
  - Dont forget I moved to Antwerp and had to deal with a breakup during this project. It might not be extremely tough, but not yet having stability at home did not help.
  - I showed I am capable of modelling things, teaching juniors, connecting with clients, showing ownership and responsibility.
  - If I were more experienced, the modelling would have been a lot easier. Next time, I should focus on keeping a healthy personal spirit.

Have I done everything to make this career work?
  - Consistent exercise, balanced diet, and regular meditation.
  - Having a life outside of A&M: events, friends and family, having a partner, etc.
  - Being strict about personal barriers: not doing weekend work, having holidays, etc.
  - Setting yourself up for success: noise-cancelling headphones.
  - Could I care less? Be less of a perfectionist?
  - Push back on certain tasks, approaches.

Things I value about this job
  - People are being supportive, knowledgeable, motivated, etc.
  - Working from home or on-site - no strict need to work from the office.
  - High base pay, high bonuses, and possibility to earn significant amounts of money through rainmaking
  - Technical aspects, i.e., modelling
  - Importance of relationships, networking, stakeholder management
  - Consistent learning of financial acumen

Personal values: efficiency, technical mastery, managing boundaries, managing stakeholders, (financial) reward. 
  
What really bothers me?
  - It is again Friday evening and having to do modelling work during tonight. 
  - Really makes me want to quit the work.
  - Just not feasible given the current cost basis.
  - Not yet having better things to do on a Friday evening is not a reason. Eventually, this is the aim.
  - Guess it is normally when close to a deadline.
  - It would be a lot easier of leadership would be more involved.

Attitude
  - Error from team MD; he has mindset that we are consultants and are to take shit.
  - According to Troy, this is on Apollo because they suggested to do all of  this work themselves.
  - It is also close to the final deadline - which makes sense
  - However, it is the same as with your relationship. Pushing and pushing because you dont want to give in. But once having to make the decision, you cant believe you didnt trust your gut and quit earlier.
  - Start looking for a new job, cash the bonus, and be out by the end of the year.
  
  ===

  What about doing this work on a self-employed basis instead of A&M?
  What about going corporate?
  - Solid work-life balance, pay/hr will be significantly better and close to no stress (considering evening/weekend work)
  - Belgium corporate - similar to DEME. There is a certain corporate culture experience to it.
  
  ===
  
  Thinking about the relationship with Mathilde (pictures, moments, etc.) makes me feel extremely sad so I should do so as little as possible.
  However, there is still value in learning from it and that is where it gets a bit tricky. I can slip into the trap of longing to these moments without learning anything from it.
  
  ===
  
  Being assertive.

  1.Workload Management: How much does your current workload sit within an acceptable boundary? 
  How often do you feel stressed or overwhelmed with the amount you must do vs. feeling motivated by what you can achieve.
  2.Availability Outside Working Hours: How often do you find yourself working outside of regular business hours? Are 
  you comfortable with the boundaries between your professional and personal time?
  3.Communication Preferences: How do you prefer to communicate with colleagues or clients? Are there 
  communication methods or channels that you find intrusive or overwhelming?
  4.Decision-Making Involvement: In team projects or decision-making processes, how comfortable are you expressing 
  your opinions or advocating for your ideas? Do you feel your input is valued?
  5.Task Delegation: How comfortable are you with delegating tasks to others? Are there specific tasks you find 
  challenging to delegate, and if so, why?
  6.Professional Development Boundaries: To what extent do you feel comfortable setting boundaries around your 
  professional development and your opportunity to attend conferences, networking events, social events or training? 
  Are there factors that limit your participation in such activities?
  7.Personal Space in the Workplace: How do you feel about your personal space in the workplace? Are there specific 
  instances where you feel your personal space is not respected, and how do you address it?
  8.Feedback: How do you handle feedback and constructive criticism? Are there situations where you find it 
  challenging to set boundaries around feedback, and if so, why?
  9.Requests for Additional Responsibilities: How do you respond to requests for additional responsibilities or tasks 
  beyond your current role? Are you comfortable saying "no" when necessary, and do you communicate your 
  limitations clearly?

  Main challenges to me are 2 and 7.
  - Receiving requests to work outside of office hours creates a lot of tension because someone else is taking my personal time away.
    I value my free time a lot: that is why living on my own is so great, it provides structure, routine, peace.
    It is a way for me to recharge and recover.
    Having someone else take this away -often unforeseen- is a big stressor to me.
  - Whenever I need to work, I prefer to do so in a calm environment because I can think a lot better.
    Having to perform under conditions that are not optimal just does not feel great.
  
  What does this mean for me? 
  - Establishing personal boundaries and communicating those in a respectful way to the team.

  Why is this important?
  - One of the biggest stressors in life is when others are dictating my time. Even more so when it occurs due to bad management decisions, outside of regular working hours, without appreciation.
  - Regardless of whether or not I will keep this job, being able to manage this better will make my life a lot more pleasant.
  - This is the main lesson from this project to me, I went way overboard in terms of weekend work. Although I am happy with the outcome, this is not something I wish someone to go through.
  - Becoming more knowledgeable about the work will help a lot. Being more assertive is a more effective lever.

  Next steps: 1. identify your boundaries and 2. communicate your boundaries.
  
  Choose your level of hard.
  - What do I mean by this? Look, the work is tough: long hours, complex challenges, challenging stakeholder relationship (internal / external), irregular requests, etc.
  - And when comparing this job to other professions, it seems stupid to decide to do this career. Why the hell would I want to spend to many hours working?
  - Not sure yet, exposing yourself to challenges leads to growth. I have gotten a lot better at doing work, managing relationships, coaching others, etc.
  - Question is, should I care about chasing this kind of growth?
  - Wont every job have a certain amount of suboptimal elements? The idea of this perfect job is illusive.
  - Every job will have its downsides.
  - Although I went/am going through some shit periods, this is rather exception than a rule. Gutfeeling is not decided yet but at this moment, I do think I am in a good spot at A&M.
  - Keep learning / growing, keep considering alternatives, etc.
  - From time to time, reflect on your values and expectations just to see if this profession is still the right one.
  - In all honesty, if I am more confident in my skills / abilities, dare to speak up more, be more assertive, this job wont get the best of me.
  
  ===  
  
  From an outsider point of view, my life is quite perfect
  - I am doing a job that interests me, is in line with my strengths, have a team around me that is nice, have people I can look up to, which pays a lot.
    My utilization is through the roof - showing mgmt supports me and I am capable to do the job
  - I am living in a penthouse near Antwerp south park: phenomenal view, terasse.
  - I can train in the Brick and currently close to one of my best physique. The gym includes a sauna and massage. The more I can open up, the more friends I will make over there.
  - I have good variety of friends that I regularly meet up with - I haven't had a weekend without any social contact
  - I am healthy, both mentally and physically
  - I have an exciting future ahead: MTB in Italy later this year, big bonus that will pay for a vehicle which will enable me to travel a lot more.
  
  There are so many things I would like to writing about.

  Your five years with Mathilde were meaningful and there is no harm in moving on. 
  - Connecting with yourself, others, and the world. This is something that I did not do enough when being with her.
  - Understanding the value of the all-in alterego and the limitations it brings. 
  - Mindfully engaging with your friends; having them come over, do things together.
  - No need to find a girlfriend now - you are not yet at your best meaning the partner you would attract is not the best one - yet.
  - Getting the sixpack is now the main goal for the next 4 weeks: OMAD, focus on recovery / meditation / stretching. Routine: Mon-Fri -> morning workouts + evening cardio sessions. Sat-Sun -> cycling, long walks, massages, recovery.
  - You are starting to get sharper, more mindful, more connected to yourself and others.
  
  The similarity between sports and business. What makes athletes succeed and how to carry over to your work.
  - Train at a level that is more challenging than the one you would need to perform. You wont suddenly tap into your best self when it is game day. You should prepare at 150% to perform at 100%.
  - Running at 15km/hr pushed you to run with better form, more focus, higher intensity. This you can then apply when running at an easier pace. There is value in pushing limits.
  - The importance of warm up. Often times one does not feel like doing sports. By taking small, seemingly irrelevant steps, one can get himself in a state of ready for work.
  - Consistency is where the real challenge sits. No one has issues with going for a run until they puke. But the percentage of people that is able to consistently go for a run every single day...
  - Things in life are not difficult to execute. Where it become difficult is when they have to be done consistently.
  - Environment is everything. One should put himself in an environment that fuels himself. Live somewhere where you have easy access to sports, nature, motivated people, smart people, ambitious people.
  - Getting into a state of focus.
  - Importance of trust.

  What personally drives me and how to artificially get into the zone by setting myself up for it.
  - The feeling of achieving success and accomplishment.
  -- Receiving positive reviews after a few months of consistent hard work.
  -- Looking lean and strong. The result of months of eating healthily and consistent exercise.

  The value of consistently improving oneself by systematically focussing on those things that have the highest marginal benefit to you.
  - At this moment, the one thing that I could do to significantly improve my life is to meditate on a consistent basis.

  Professional goals
  - Revisit project Wrap, establish learnings, summarize a case.
  - Making senior associate in 2025.
  - Leading the Belgium office of Alvarez and Marsal.
  - Leveraging A&M brand to realize a nice exit.
  - Become CEO of a company in distress - after some years doing this work I am confident that I will be able to land a job as a CEO at a firm in distress. 
    This might be the holy grail: independent = more money to me, independent = one-man show and more control over your day.
  
  Personal goals
  - Currently living in Antwerp - I would deem this a temporary place that will enable me to get fit, establish friendships, build career momentum, and live closer to myself.
  - Keep renting this place.
  - Get lean and have a visible six pack. Weight should be c. 87kg.
  - Maintain this fitness and gradually build muscle.
  - Upgrade the wardrobe entirely (clean up everything from the basics and invest in two styles: personal and professional outfits).
  - Meditation, yoga, and relaxation (watching movies, writing blog, getting massages).
  - Get a car. Aside from the monetary aspect, having a car opens up so many things you could do: just ride, travel to campings, MTB areas, the coast, friends and family.
    
  Social goals
  - What has been working
  -- Having people come over
  -- Be more approachable
  -- Post things on Instagram ~ city vibes, events, your appartment
  -- Lose weight
  -- Meditate
  -- Dress better
  -- Tinder
  -- Transfer to Crossfit over summer - when lean and comfortable training w/ naked upper body (Crossfit is fun / effective and people are more open than in the gym)
    - Developing the social alter ego of myself and put it out there.
  - Reading the book "Captivate"
  - Invite people over to your place
  -- A summer party at your terrasse
  -- A birthday party at Fiera
  -- Wine tasting
  - Dare to go out there as well - when people invite you
  - Be selective with whom you spend your time:
  -- Thibault Cloet: MTB, adventure, travel
  -- Thibault Vandenhove, Viktor, Jan, Matthijs, Dries: fine wining and dining, travel
  -- Roberto, Emmanuel: locals in Antwerp, having drinks
  -- The Brick: TBD - would like to develop a social circle at the gym
  -- Sus, Arne: career-like minded people, travel
  -- High school friends: just stay in touch
  
  What would be the traits of this social alter ego?
  - Inner thoughts shut off
  - Approachable
  - Attentive, actively listening
  - Exiting
  - Talking about things that excite you as well, asking their advice, showing pictures

  How would you describe your professional alter ego?
  - Knowledgeable
  - Effective
  - Determined
  - Pet peeves: uncommitted, unrespectfull, lack of knowledge, weakness.

  Where did I drop the ball on project Wrap?
  - I should never have allowed others to make changes in the model. It led to a lot of frustration and me just not taking ownership of the model anymore.
  - I should have pushed back on workload and should have communicated my workload better to prevent having to work too many hours.
  - Big picture thinking, spending time going through the outcome of analyses.
  
  Points of improvement
  - Model
  -- Modelling the debt and lease liabilities better: base structure should be different, i.e., vertically, split between cash/non-cash, allowing for scenarios, etc.
  -- Output 
  
  Things that I did well
  - The model structure was solid for having built a 3st for the first time. I have a lot more comfort going forward with this.
  - Stakeholder management, i.e., developing relationships with stakeholders.
  - Coaching of Nadine.
  - Feedback to Troy.
  
  Your personal alter ego?
  - Reflective
  - Mindful
  - Kind
  
  I get so fucking annoyed with certain people their behaviour.
  - The fat foreigner in the sauna caughing up the entire place.
  - That one colleague knowing jack shit about modelling, giving stupid tasks, and not being able to answer any fucking question.
  - The stupid girlfriend being unable to properly communicate with me.
  Could these behaviours be less impactful for a different persona? I guess a compassionate one could certainly help.
  
  Being alone feels lonely only at certain times:
  - Sunday evenings with the workweek ahead.
  - During birthday parties, holidays, or weekends - times which you could normally spend with a significant other.
  - They will feel even lonier when seeing Mathilde spend time with a new boyfriend, with the cats, at the house in Laarne.

  Sometimes, I just want to drink and not think about work. Work requires me to problem solve and it's part of my brain that I just do not feel like tapping into - because it takes quite some effort.

  What is the point of all of this? Looking back over the last 4 months: these were great months. Why do I still feel so empty - if that is the right word?
  - The last months were about generating results, accomplishments. Although those led to feel-good moments, they were only short-lived.
  - The feeling you have right now is the need for connection with the world, with people, with a partner.
  - I overcome loneliness by intentionally creating connection — with friends who get me, strangers who see me, and eventually, a partner who meets me. 
  - But I also practice being with myself — without needing to escape that solitude. I do so through journalling, meditation, exercise - generally just taking care of myself.
  
  What could I do differently in the next four months to avoid this feeling?
  - Open yourself up to connecting with yourself and with others. Dare to reach out, consistently invest in others, be approachable wherever you go.
  - Do more of the things that allow you to build a connection, both with yourself, with others, and with the world.
  - Zoom inwards through meditation and journalling / writing blog posts. It will make everything else more effective.

  

  ===
  What makes me feel connected with myself?
  - Blogging
  - Taking a shower
  - Watching a movie
  - Meditation
  - Sports (cardio, once warmed up and in a certain zone)
  - Having a glass of alcohol, watching a good movie, while eating a kapsalon, spaghetti, french fries.
  - Receiving very good feedback from the team.
  - Performing an intense workout session; no aches, comfortable clothing, good music, good amount of preworkout, well rested. Yes, would die for these kind of workouts.

  How does it feel when engaging in these activities?
  - It feels as if they unlock a new dimension in my mind.
  - I am free of worries and anxiety. 
  - I feel absorbed by the activity.

  ===
  What makes me feel connected with others?
  - Just have simple interactions with people.
  - Have people come over and listen to them, share your money with them, give them a good time.
  - Making friendly eye contact with someone else.
  - Having a chat in the sauna with someone else.
  - Asking someone for advice.

  How do I feel when engaging in these activities?
  - During, I feel somehow connected to the others.
  - After, I feel energized and grateful for having these people around me.

  ===
  Relationship thoughts
  - Perhaps my perspective on love changes after reading this one book arriving tomorrow? Love for myself and love for others.
  - I keep falling into certain traps that prevent me from truly being happy. Trap of falling into this alter ego of professional elitist - thinking this could replace connection with world.
  - I long for connection more than anything else - I have been living the perfect life over the last months but still feel completely empty. Connection with myself, others, the world.
  - I did not understand this while living together with Mathilde and was seeking for fulfillment in work, fitness, material elements. Rather than focus on feeling.
  - The reason why I am beginning to understand this only now is because I have achieved all of those things and learned none of these give the fulfillment I am looking for.
  - I must seek them outside of work. This is not something that comes natural to me
  - Always need to think of that thing I mentioned to therapist: Mathilde prevents me from being me true self, that one that goes all in. But it is not that black and white.
    This Ruben is only part of it. There is also a Ruben that wants to go to flower markets,  to have ice cream, to go to wineyards, picnic in the park, eat spaghetti.
    The challenges lays in finding a way to make all of them happy.
  - Just a thought scenario but could Ruben also be happy if he did not pursue this kind of career or level of fitness? Could he be happy by embracing a completely different set of values?
  - Why has Mathilde been in so many ways but could I not understand this when being with her? Simple things like, going to the Brick, going to techno festivals, the value of crying. 
  - I cant put my finger on what the cause is yet but I am starting to understand things. 
  - In what ways have I changed over the last months?
    - Have been pushing my social relationships myself, not falling back on others.
    - I have been crying a lot over the last months.
    - I am beginning to understand I have been out of touch with the world, disconnected and how it affects me.
    - This disconnection might be a cause for the relationship problems we have had.
    - Solely focussing on the alter ego of going all in, completely disregarding others does not provide fulfillment.
    - I can understand the value of the relationship given the gap that I currently experience.
  - Is there any value in revisiting experiencing and reflecting on these?
    - Therapy -> so completely misaligned and she not 'seeing' certain things
    - London -> too much noise for me
    - Arguments -> not giving enough space
  - Note: It is not my intention to get back together with Mathilde. However, it is my duty to learn something from the relationship else I will keep falling in the same trap.

  Professional tips
  - When doing an analysis and you dont seem to understand it, just gather more information. At some point you will just understand the problem.
  - Underpromise, overdeliver. Manage expectations, keep things up your sleeve --> makes work more exciting and more comfortable. If you dont, it will drain you because others do not care about your wellbeing / time.
  - Networking works best when it is happens naturally and authentically. And let this be your main focus point at this moment, i.e., being present and connecting with yourself, other, the world.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  Some thoughts
  - You should get a girlfriend from Antwerp. You love the city, you see yourself living there, now it is time to find someone that lives there as well - someone from Antwerp.
  - Mathilde was likely not the right person for you. It is true that you should have spent more effort into listening to her, communicating, etc.
    However, the base effort to love one another was just too much. It sucked so much energy out of you such that there was none left to enjoy being together.
  - Perhaps having a baby is not such a bad idea after all - seeing how beautiful it us with Sus. Note these are momentary experiences. 
  - Perhaps you should start telling more of your stories as well, just share things about yourself such that you give people the chance to connect with you.
    - Personal interests: MTB, blogging, sauna and relaxation
    - Work: strategic decisions, money, prestige
    - Social: travel, girlfriends, etc.
  - Perhaps you could take the next month leaning down a bit more but you may already be happy where you have gotten. No stress.
  - The idea of getting a vehicle to travel around, having those early mornings to go camping, going MTB with Thibault, etc.

  The relationship with Mathilde was not healthy: we fought a lot, had many discussions, were not engaging in healthy behavior, were not getting the best out of ourselves, etc.
  Our brain has a strange way of telling us stuff. Things that are familiar to us give us a feeling of comfort and happiness. 
  This is also true for relations, environments, etc. that are destructive to us.
